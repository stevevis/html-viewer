# HTML Viewer and Summarizer

This web app fetches the HTML from a given URL and displays the source to the user.

A summary of the document is displayed, listing which tags are present in the HTML and how many of each tag.

Clicking on the name of each tag in the summary will highlight the tags in the source code view.
